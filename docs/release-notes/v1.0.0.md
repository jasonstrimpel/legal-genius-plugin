- **gap-analyzer** — Exhaustive clause-by-clause gap analysis with no cap on gaps found, scored on Legal Risk (1-5) and Business Risk (1-5)
- **audit-reviewer** — Independent fact-check of every claim, quote, and score against source documents
- **target-to-docx** — Converts target PDF to docx via LibreOffice for redlining
- **redline-editor** — Applies OOXML tracked changes to target docx for every gap recommendation (author: "Andersen Consulting")
- **report-formatter** — Converts gap analysis to formatted Word document (Times New Roman 11pt, structured tables)

### Gap Analysis Report (Sections A-D)

- **D. Relevance Assessment** — Flags tax-specific benchmark clauses not applicable to consulting
